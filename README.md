# EE120A-mini-project
# Creators: Brittiney Sempasa and Ruth Navarette
For our mini project we were required to create a four way cross-walk
which would recieve user input by way of a button to allow that user 
to cross the street. 

Without user input, either the North/South or East/West lights should stay on
for 3 clock cycles and switch to the opposite lights and will continue
this until user input is given. Once the user wants to cross the street 
the walk signal for either the North/South and East/West side will remain 
on for 5 clock cycles and then go back to alternating every 3 clock cycles.
